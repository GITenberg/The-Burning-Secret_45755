description: BURNING SECRET is set in an Austrian sanatorium in the 1920's. A lonely
  twelve-year-old boy is befriended and becomes infatuated by a suave and mysterious
  baron who heartlessly brushes him aside to turn his seductive attentions to the
  boy's mother. Stefan Zweig, the author of Beware of Pity and Confusion provides
  the reader, in this newly available translation, with a study of childhood on the
  brink of adolescence and a boy's uncontrollable jealousy and feelings of betrayal.
